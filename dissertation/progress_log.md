# Progress log

One short entry per working session. Feeds the methodology chapter and the weekly
supervisor notes. Newest entries at the bottom.

- Set up the repository scaffolding from CLAUDE.md: folder tree, an `src` package
  with one subpackage per pipeline component, and `data/raw`, `data/interim`,
  `data/processed`, plus `config`, `notebooks`, `outputs`, `tests`, `dissertation`.
- Added `.gitignore` (Python ML), `requirements.txt` (pinned late-2024 baseline,
  reproducibility over latest), and `README.md` (project summary and local Windows
  GPU setup).
- Initialised a local-only git repository (no remote, kept private) and committed
  the scaffolding.
- Decisions recorded: keep stable version pins, do not chase latest; `bitsandbytes`
  is only needed for the Phase 4 Llama QLoRA fine-tuning, which will run on HPC, so
  any local install trouble is non-blocking for now.
- Next: local environment install and GPU verification (Step 2), then BAWE download
  and corpus summary (Step 3).
